## The invariance problem

The human brain is still better at recognizing the same object from different angles than any artificial intelligence system. This is due to what is known as the "invariance problem".

### What is the invariance problem?


In machine learning, particularly in computer vision, the invariance problem refers to the challenge of designing models that can recognize objects regardless of variations in their appearance. These variations can include changes in scale, rotation, lighting conditions, and viewpoint.
