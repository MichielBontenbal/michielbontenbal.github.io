## Welcome!

Welcome to my blog. I am a lecturer at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences where I teach (applied) Artificial Intelligence. 

In this blog I will write here about things that I want to share with a wider audience than just my classroom.

What you will find here is a combination of blogs, tutorials and notes. 

I am writing about the things that i lecture in, such as: Computer Vision and Generative AI for Vision, AI assisted coding (aka vbe coding), and projects I do with my students.

Also I will write about the impact of AI in society and how it will change so many things in our society. I will do this from a technical perspective as others can get a deeper understanding of the technology behind AI.

There might be an occasional blog in Dutch.
